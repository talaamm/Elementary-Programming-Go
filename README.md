Hello there,
It's Tala again! this repository includes most the exams questions & solutions for 01-edu platform, Adam program at NotreDame University - Jerusalem Global Gateway.
I made it to help my colleagues and hopefully the future students.

I tried to include some explanations. If you need further help, please reach out to me:

Discord: @talaamm_

Note: you can find the questions here: https://github.com/01-edu/public/tree/master/subjects
By searching the questions name (which is also the file's name).

Hope you find it helpful & useful!
